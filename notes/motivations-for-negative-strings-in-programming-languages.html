    # Motivation for Negative Strings in programming languages</p>
<p>Say we want to remove the first part of a string.
Specifically, let's take the "glad" out of "gladiator".</p>
<p>The standard way is to call the "slice" method of the longer string ("gladiator")
with the length of the other string as an argument.</p>
<pre><code class="javascript language-javascript">const gladiator = "gladiator";
const glad = "glad";
const iator = gladiator.slice(glad.length);
console.log({iator});
</code></pre>
<p>Similarly, we can use the slice method to remove the last part of a string.</p>
<pre><code class="javascript language-javascript">const gladiator = "gladiator";
const iator = "iator";
const glad = gladiator.slice(0, -iator.length);
console.log({glad});
</code></pre>
<p>Now, if we want to do the opposite, can do this:</p>
<pre><code class="javascript language-javascript">const glad = "glad";
const iator = "iator";
const gladiator = glad + iator;
console.log({gladiator});
</code></pre>
<p>Main Question: Why can't we do this?</p>
<pre><code class="javascript language-javascript">const gladiator = "gladiator";
const glad = "gladiator" - "iator";// or "gladiator" + -"iator"
const iator = - "glad" + iator;
console.log({glad, iator});
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li><p>for Numbers is not the same as + for strings in javascript.</p></li>
<li><p>+ for Numbers represents additon</p></li>
<li><p>+ for strings represeents concatination</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The + operatore is "overloaded" --
the associated (hidden) addition function behaves differently
given the context.</p>
<p>Some languages like PHP make this explicit by
using different operators to represent additon and concationation.</p>
<p>String Concatenation</p>
<pre><code class="php language-php">$glad = "glad";
$iator = "iator";
$gladiator = $glad . $iator;
echo $gladiator;
</code></pre>
<p>Numeric Addition</p>
<pre><code class="php language-php">$one = 1;
$two = 2;
$three = 1 + 2;
echo $three;
</code></pre>
<p>We can't do it because the + operator represents concatenation, not addition.</p>
<p>But what if we could…</p>
<h1 id="groups">Groups</h1>
<p>Before discuss implementing such a thing, let's think about math for a bit.</p>
<p>Understanding how "negative numbers" work might give us insight into "negative strings" <em>should</em> work.</p>
<h2 id="groupdefinition">Group Definition</h2>
<p>Under addition, numbers form what's know a "group".</p>
<p>For any group <em>G</em>, with operation <em>⋅</em>, the following is true:</p>
<pre><code class="javascript language-javascript">2 + 4 === 6;
</code></pre>
<h3 id="closure">Closure</h3>
<p>For all <em>a</em>, <em>b</em> in <em>G</em>, the result of the operation, <em>a ⋅ b</em>, is also in <em>G</em>.</p>
<pre><code class="javascript language-javascript">(1 + 2) + 3 === 1 + (2 + 3) === 6
</code></pre>
<h3 id="associativity">Associativity</h3>
<p>For all <em>a</em>, <em>b</em> in <em>G</em>, <em>(a ⋅ b) ⋅ c</em> = <em>a ⋅ (b ⋅ c)</em>.</p>
<h3 id="identityelement">Identity element</h3>
<p>There exists an element <em>e</em> in <em>G</em> such that, for every element <em>a</em> in <em>G</em>, the equation <em>e ⋅ a</em> = <em>a ⋅ e</em> = <em>a</em> holds. Such an element is unique (see below), and thus one speaks of the identity element.</p>
<pre><code class="javascript language-javascript">8 + 0 === 8; // e = 0
</code></pre>
<h3 id="inverseelement">Inverse element</h3>
<p>For each <em>a</em> in <em>G</em>, there exists an element <em>b</em> in <em>G</em>, commonly denoted <em>a<sup>−1</sup></em> (or <em>−a</em>, if the operation is denoted "+"), such that <em>a ⋅ b</em> = <em>b ⋅ a</em> = <em>e</em>, where e is the identity element.</p>
<pre><code class="javascript language-javascript">16 + (-16) === 0; // b is the negative
</code></pre>
<p>Under concatenation, strings form what's know a "monoid" --
a group without the notion of an "inverse element".</p>
<p>Consider the following a variable <em>a</em>.</p>
<p>If <em>a</em> is a number, the inverse of a is <em>-a</em> := -1*<em>a</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>How would we define <em>-a</em> if <em>a</em> is a string?</p>
<ul>
<li>Could we define "-1 for strings" and multiply it by a?</li>
<li>Could we redefine * to allow for multiplying numbers by strings?</li>
<li>Must we use multiplications at all? Could  <em>-a</em> := <em>whatever we want</em>?</li></ul></li>
<li><p>How would we represent this in code?</p></li>
<li><p>Add features to existing string object?</p>
<ul>
<li>How does the current string object work?</li>
<li>What would need to change?</li></ul></li>
<li><p>Create entirely new object?</p>
<ul>
<li>(How) do we maintain compatibility with existing strings?</li></ul></li>
<li><p>How would we display this to a user in a way that makes sense?</p></li>
<li><p>What alternative representations exist?</p>
<ul>
<li>Styles? Colors? Characters?</li></ul></li>
<li><p>What problems might this cause?</p></li>
<li><p>What are some other dissimilar features of number and strings that they might be able to share with eachother?</p></li>
<li><p>Can we multiply strings by eachother? </p>
<ul>
<li>Can we multiply strings by numbers (verctor spaces)? (Ruby does this sort of)</li></ul>
